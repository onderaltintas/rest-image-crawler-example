# rest-image-crawler-example
Simple example of rest image crawler. For everyun from boxxy.
Greetings,

Have no linux right now,also checked virtual machines, I must have deleted em. So couldn't create good crone job. It should be something like:

* * * * *  /usr/local/bin/npmpath/node /applicationpath/scrap.js

Firstly the node application should have been started because scrap uses a rest service of the application (getuserlist)

- Couldn't write tests. Passed 90 minutes way too much (17.00 - 21.30). It takes too much effort to complete all these tasks together. Completed jsdocs anyways.
- Could use prototypes but every class will have one instance anyways. Won't matter.

Regards,
